# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 29, 2026**

## Introduction

PaperFlow ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our web-based PDF editor at paperflow.app (the "Service").

## Our Privacy-First Approach

PaperFlow is designed with privacy as a core principle. **Your documents never leave your device.** All PDF processing, editing, and rendering happens entirely in your web browser using client-side technologies.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- **Document Content**: We never see, access, store, or transmit your PDF files or their contents
- **Personal Files**: Your documents remain on your device at all times
- **Signatures**: Any signatures you create are stored only in your browser's local storage
- **Form Data**: Information you enter into PDF forms stays on your device

## Information We May Collect

### Anonymous Usage Analytics

To improve PaperFlow, we may collect anonymous, aggregated data about how the application is used:

- **Page Views**: Which features and pages are visited (without identifying you)
- **Feature Usage**: Anonymous counts of which tools are used
- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, rendering performance
- **Error Reports**: Anonymous crash reports to help us fix bugs

This data is:
- Completely anonymous (no personal identifiers)
- Aggregated across all users
- Used solely to improve the application
- Never sold to third parties

### Technical Information

When you visit our website, we may automatically receive:

- **Browser Type**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android
- **Screen Resolution**: To optimize the user interface
- **Language Preference**: To provide localized content

This information helps us ensure PaperFlow works well across different platforms.

## Local Storage

PaperFlow uses your browser's local storage features to enhance your experience:

- **IndexedDB**: Stores your saved signatures, stamps, and recent file list (file names only, not content)
- **LocalStorage**: Stores your preferences (theme, zoom level, tool settings)
- **Service Worker Cache**: Enables offline functionality

You can clear this data at any time through:
1. Your browser's settings (Clear browsing data > Cookies and site data)
2. PaperFlow's Settings > Clear Data option

## Data Security

Since your documents never leave your device:

- There is no server-side data to breach
- Your files cannot be intercepted in transit
- No cloud storage means no cloud vulnerabilities

For locally stored data (signatures, preferences):
- Signatures are encrypted before storage
- Data is sandboxed to the PaperFlow domain
- Only you can access your browser's local storage

## Third-Party Services

### Error Monitoring (Sentry)

We use Sentry for error tracking with privacy-preserving configuration:
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is automatically scrubbed
- Error reports contain only technical information
- No document content is ever included

### Analytics

If we use analytics services, they are configured to:
- Not collect IP addresses
- Not use cookies for tracking
- Only gather anonymous, aggregated metrics

## Children's Privacy

PaperFlow does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The Service is designed for general audiences and does not require any personal information to use.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:

- **Access**: See what data is stored in your browser (use browser developer tools)
- **Delete**: Clear all locally stored data at any time
- **Portability**: Export your signatures and settings

Since we don't collect personal data on our servers, there is no server-side data to request, modify, or delete.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

**Summary**: PaperFlow processes your documents locally in your browser. We don't collect your files, signatures, or personal information. We may collect anonymous usage statistics to improve the application. Your privacy is protected by design.
